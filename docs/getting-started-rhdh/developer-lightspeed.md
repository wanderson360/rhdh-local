Developer Lightspeed for Red Hat Developer Hub (often shortened to "Developer Lightspeed for RHDH" or simply "Lightspeed") is a general-purpose AI-powered virtual assistant designed to help developers with a multitude of daily questions and tasks. Whether you need help with coding, debugging, understanding technologies, or navigating Red Hat Developer Hub, Developer Lightspeed is available 24/7 to provide assistance. Developer Lightspeed is an optional feature (an '[extension](extensions.md) or plugin') that must be installed and configured by your administrator, so it may not be available on your Developer Hub instance.

## What is Developer Lightspeed and why is it useful?

**Developer Lightspeed for RHDH** is a natural language interface powered by generative AI that serves as your general-purpose development assistant. It can help with coding questions, technology explanations, troubleshooting, best practices, and much more. When answering questions about Red Hat Developer Hub specifically, it can provide accurate, cited answers based on official documentation.

!!! info "AI-Powered 🤖"

    Developer Lightspeed uses Generative AI LLM models and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, which means when answering questions about Red Hat Developer Hub, it has access to official documentation and can provide accurate, cited answers based on those sources. For general development questions, it leverages its entire model training data to provide helpful guidance and explanations.

!!! tip "Always Available 💬"

    Unlike waiting for a colleague to be available or searching through multiple documentation sites, Developer Lightspeed is always ready to help. Ask questions at any time, in any order, and get immediate responses to a wide variety of development-related questions.

    Developer Lightspeed isn't limited to Red Hat Developer Hub questions (assuming your administrator has turned off 'safety guard' mode). It can help with coding challenges, technology explanations, debugging assistance, architecture decisions, best practices, and any other development-related questions you might have throughout your day.
