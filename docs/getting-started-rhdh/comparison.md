If you're new to Red Hat Developer Hub, you might be wondering how it relates to CNCF Backstage, the open-source project it's based on. Understanding the relationship and differences between these two platforms can help you better understand what Red Hat Developer Hub offers and why your organization might have chosen it.

Red Hat Developer Hub is built directly on top of CNCF Backstage, which means you get all the same core features and capabilities. However, RHDH adds enterprise-grade features, support, and production-ready capabilities that make it easier to deploy and maintain in enterprise environments.

!!! tip "Built on Open Source, Enhanced for Enterprise 🚀"

    Red Hat Developer Hub is built from CNCF Backstage. If you're already using Backstage, you can migrate to RHDH without losing any of the core functionality. RHDH adds enterprise features, support, and production-ready capabilities on top of the open-source foundation.
